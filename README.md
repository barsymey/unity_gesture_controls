# unity_gesture_controls

A test task project.

Here three types of character input control method are realised: keys, swipe, and drag.
Ability to change the current method is implemented via pause menu.
Observer pattern is used in dropdown menu for changing contols and for registring swipe events (though i'm not shure if i got the idea of this pattern right).
A single menu element is used.
